# Digiapi
APIOps joint project to collaborately develop an API idea of the National Library of Finland. Aim is to:
* define API Model Canvas or two for the case and 
* provide Swagger 2.0 based descriptions for the APIs and
* mockup servers for prototyping 

Of course for APIOPS as a whole, one aim is to learn by doing. 

## Business models
Business models for this case are in wiki: https://github.com/APIOps/Digiapi/wiki/DigiAPI

## API designs in Swagger 2.0 format
In progress version of the [meta API spec](https://github.com/APIOps/Digiapi/blob/master/node-mockup-api/api/swagger/swagger.yaml)  

## Mockup servers
