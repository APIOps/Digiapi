# Digiapi
APIOps joint project to collaborately develop an API idea of the National Library of Finland. Aim is to:
* define API Model Canvas or two for the case and 
* provide Swagger 2.0 based descriptions for the APIs and
* mockup servers for prototyping 

Of course for APIOPS as a whole, one aim is to learn by doing.
