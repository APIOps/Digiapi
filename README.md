# Digiapi
APIOps joint project to collaborately develop an API idea of the National Library of Finland. Aim is to:
* define API Model Canvas or two for the case and 
* provide Swagger 2.0 based descriptions for the APIs and
* mockup servers for prototyping 

Of course for APIOPS as a whole, one aim is to learn by doing. 

## People and roles

* Tuula Pääkkönen: client and responsible for API Model Canvas
* Jarkko Moilanen: APItalist, responsible for development process and API design
* Jani Karhunen: developer, one of our API consumers/testers/validator (more needed!)


## Business models
