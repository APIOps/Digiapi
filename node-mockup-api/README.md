# DigiAPI mockup Node server

This constantly updated mockup server is for developers of the spec and for others to test API locally. Server will be used until we (developers/API -consumers/customer) are happy with the design. After that backend connections are created. 
You can run the API locally and develop API Swagger 2.0 spec with ready-made tools. Instructions below. 

## Install npm and node

## Install swagger module

We utilize Swagger node module in development. It bundles node server and Swagger editor in one package. 

[Details for swagger module installation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node/blob/master/docs/install.md)
