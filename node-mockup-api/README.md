# DigiAPI mockup Node server

This constantly updated mockup server is for developers of the spec and for others to test API locally. Server will be used until we (developers/API -consumers/customer) are happy with the design. After that backend connections are created. 
You can run the API locally and develop API Swagger 2.0 spec with ready-made tools. You will need: 
* npm
* node
* Swagger module

## 2. Install swagger module

We utilize Swagger node module in development. It bundles node server and Swagger editor in one package. The swagger module is designed for Node.js and is available through npm.

### Installing on Linux / Mac

Here's how you install with `sudo`.

1. Open a terminal. 
2. Run the install:

    `sudo npm install -g swagger`

**Note**: `sudo` may or may not be required with the `-g` option depending on your configuration. If you do not use `-g`, you may need to add the `swagger/bin` directory to your PATH manually. On Unix-based machines 
the bin directory will often be found here: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/swagger/bin`.

### Installing on Windows
